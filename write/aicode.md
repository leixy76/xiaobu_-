I've been using Claude Code for a couple of days, and it has been absolutely ruthless in chewing through legacy bugs in my gnarly old code base. It's like a wood chipper fueled by dollars. It can power through shockingly impressive tasks, using nothing but chat. 

You don't even select context. You just open your heart and your wallet, and Claude Code takes the wheel. It even helps keep you in the loop by prompting you every eight seconds to ask if it can use basic read-only commands that you would allow _anyone_, even North Korean hackers, to run on your machine. 

But you learn to watch it carefully, because it pushes *hard*. As long as the bank authorizations keep coming through, it will push on bug fixes until they're deployed in production, and then start scanning through the user logs to see how well it's doing.

Claude Code's form factor is clunky as hell, it has no multimodal support, and it's hard to juggle with other tools. But it doesn't matter. It might look antiquated but it makes Cursor, Windsurf, Augment and the rest of the lot (yeah, ours too, and Copilot, let's be honest) FEEL antiquated. 

I know it's experimental, and we don't know all its limits yet. But from my experience so far, it feels like a bigger step into the future than any we've seen since coding assistants came out. 

So. Not only does Anthropic have the best model out there for coding in the real world, they also seem to know how to use it better than anyone else.

Between them always having the best models, the best chatbot interfaces, the best predictions from their CEO, and now Claude Code -- I've begun to suspect that Anthropic is literally the only company on the planet who knows what the fuck is going on.
