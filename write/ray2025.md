# 雷·米尔斯谈Bushcraft、自然保护与我们和自然世界的联系


*以下是经过整理和编辑的英国BushcraftShow 2025活动上，著名的Bushcraft专家雷·米尔斯分享了他对准备、自然的重要性、自然保护挑战以及Bushcraft核心原则的见解。*

**开场白与经验的价值**

**雷·米尔斯:** 所以，我请求我们能够探讨这些问题。我们努力深入研究它们。我只想让观众们对答案满意。

**雷·米尔斯:** 是的，大家好。我真的应该谈谈这个，因为近年来，我谈论了很多关于逆境和挑战的话题。真正的技能和经验往往是在这样的条件下磨练出来的。当你们提到经验这个话题时，一个特别的事件浮现在我的脑海。

我被送到西班牙的一个小镇。我把所有的行头——我的装备——都在机场捆扎好了。出现问题的可能性看起来很小。我查看了出发信息板，然后发现飞往伦敦的航班被取消了。就在那时，你必须运用不同阶段的思维。关键在于那是最后一班出港航班，所以所有的住宿都订满了。你不能待在机场。最终，在西班牙待了大约10个小时后，我的航班本应在晚上10点起飞，我必须弄清楚我该去哪里过夜。我不能去机场；无处可去，我的交通工具显然已经离开了。

有很多事情我做不到。我没有银行卡或电话，因为它们和我的装备一起在机场。我离开了公路，无法进入高速公路。我需要帮助。另一种选择是游泳或寻找其他方法，那会很艰难。但是凭借一点技巧和远见，我找到了解决方案。那天晚上，我乘坐当地的公交车去了一个看起来可能提供免费或廉价住宿的村庄。那是一次冒险，而且一切顺利。不过，远见是关键。我旅行时总是为意外情况做好准备。如果有人出现体温过低的情况怎么办？是的，那是一次冒险，但它强化了做好准备的智慧。

这次经历，以及许多其他经历，都随着时间的推移强化了准备的智慧。

**关于必备装备和常见错误**

**雷·米尔斯:** 事实上，我经常被问到关于罕见和常见的错误。许多美丽、令人惊叹的地方，你知道，都可能带来挑战。人们穿着T恤，受到一些小因素的影响，但他们没有考虑到其含义。还有运动鞋！他们穿着什么样的裤子？他们有驱虫剂吗？有没有更好的方法来处理这个问题？你微笑的表情告诉我我的观点你明白了。还有一些其他事情让我的生活变得轻松：我不会详述，但这很重要。向导们常常重申这一点。确实如此。

所以，你出发了，天气预报说天气晴朗，但你必须根据那次经验考虑所有可能性。我们见过有人因为没有带雨具而陷入困境。他们和朋友一起犯了这个错误。你会看到这种对好天气的严重依赖。你的判断力如何？并且永远要尊重自然环境。永远。这是你所需要的。

**Bushcraft：技能、正念与社群**

**雷·米尔斯:** 那太简单化了。实际上，当你接触Bushcraft时，你会学到你需要什么。从本质上讲，这就是人们获得的。当我们教授Bushcraft时，它就是这样的。Bushcraft，在其框架内，使你能够为冒险做好准备。老实说，你不应该在计划周全的情况下需要依赖它，你知道的。在很长一段时间里，那些没有好好组织行程的人才是最需要它的人。

我在西班牙，一个有趣的关于寒冷天气的情况出现了，因为我当时也在考虑菲律宾。所以，我们谈论像雕刻勺子这样的技能。我认为这有助于培养批判性思维。嗯，这是许多人多年来犯的错误。你如何处理你的装备——例如，那件夹克，无论在什么情况下都能提供保护。永远带着它。你不能没有它。当你练习Bushcraft时，即使你没有走远，也许只是在你的花园里用树枝，那也很重要。

正念和Bushcraft已经交织在一起，尽管它并不总是被称为正念。有趣的是，在另一个国家的一个困境中，没有人陷入恐慌。一切都在几分钟内解决了。一次艰难的驾驶对其他人来说会更困难。你从Bushcraft中学到的东西会在一定程度上帮助你。这是一种态度，一种兄弟情谊。这是更宏大的东西。恐惧可以变得可控。自力更生是他们的经历所教导的。当我们教授Bushcraft时，他们不仅仅是关心自己需求的人，也关心他人。我们将在社群中看到快速的发展。在世界上互相帮助的意愿并非总是存在，但它很重要。如果你认为某事危险，它并不总是如此。那种归结为使用指南针的技能，这些东西……投入时间学习，因为知识无处不在。获得适当的培训非常重要。

多年来，人们将Bushcraft爱好者视为疯子。我们的意思是表明每一年，人类与自然的联系至关重要。它对我们和任何事物一样有益。我认为理解自然的道路不会被打败。我相信老一辈人明白这一点。许多事情通过自然变得清晰。很多积极的东西源于此。

**民族认同与全球环境挑战**

**雷·米尔斯:** 英联邦，一些国家。其中一个，芬兰，有一种自嘲的幽默。芬兰的‘sisu’概念是关于韧性的。我认为这对每个国家都是一个启示。目标是经受住挑战。而世界、政治、问题……自然本身在这个星球上面临挑战。

如果我们不尽快行动……地球表面是我们拥有的一切。我们需要共同运用浅显的常识。那意味着理解你正在使用有限的资源。如果你砍伐它们，你会影响未来。这些地球的资源至关重要。我们传递下去的东西，也希望他人能够同样珍视，这很重要。我告诉你，这就是问题所在：我们常常太慢了。也许我们开采资源，并在此过程中造成损害。最重要的事情是承担责任。而且因为学习自然会触动你的内心，它有助于传递这样一个信息，即某些人所宣扬的实际上是无稽之谈。真相在于环境。封锁期间，封锁之后，乡村涌入了大量想要接触自然的人们。现在这种接触可能受到限制。这令人担忧。这种接触乡村的权利。为什么？它如此重要。

我们Bushcraft领域的人有一个关于这个的重要信息。在某个时刻，我说，这就是我所主张的。而那些身处其中，扰乱他们环境的人没有抓住重点。真正的乐趣在于参与自然世界，我认为你可以忠于自己，建立一个强大的社群。谢谢。

**问答环节开始**

**主持人:** 谢谢。有什么问题吗？嗯，如果你有一个问题，我会拿麦克风。如果你能等一下麦克风，那就最好了。

**问题1：关于自然的治愈力量和传统知识。**
**观众:** 谢谢。在治愈方面，嗯，以及收集自然材料/知识。您是否，嗯，看到世界上发生的这些事情对此有何影响？

**雷·米尔斯:** 对。有趣的事情正在发生。我的关注点会是传统知识。对于动手学习，有一种明确的需求，它能让你记住。我记得看到……我会告诉你一个事实，呃，它给我留下了极大的印象。有证据表明我们正在以惊人的速度变暖。例如，最近，呃，我了解到为什么有些地方如此寒冷，但全球总体仍在变暖。仅仅是规模之大。冰雪融化的程度逐年增加，这令人震惊。我们每小时损失数吨冰雪。格陵兰的年轻人……而且，嗯，那些依赖冰雪的人，比如猎人，一种整个男人的生活方式，正在消失。让他们理解这个问题至关重要。每年，南格陵兰0.1%的冰雪融化，加上澳大利亚的冰雪融化，意味着地区面临着洪水来临的威胁。呃，当人们因为失去土地而不得不搬迁时，能做些什么？需要明确的是，这些事情一直在发生，但没有以这样的速度。那些地区正受到威胁。纽约也受到威胁。人们将受到影响，但他们没有意识到。问题正以指数级速度加剧，更快。火灾，都与气候有关。这影响着我们。这是一个全球性问题。

**问题2：解决全球性问题的地缘政治障碍。**
**观众 (Rich):** 呃，Rich。感谢您就许多方面所做的演讲。您谈到了地球和地缘政治，以及障碍。人与自然之间的互动，我觉得非常重要。中国的情况，一个，嗯，这方面的例子。似乎解决方案就在眼前，但未被实施。我们必须从今天开始。

**雷·米尔斯:** 他们热爱自然，但这使人们与自然脱节。当然，像木雕这样的东西已经存在多年，不仅仅是作为特殊的物品，而是作为生活的一部分。我们将在几年内看到我们的孩子们... 他们是谁？你会给他们看什么？看那棵树。国家公园，地貌，悬崖。如果不是我们自身的一部分，自然又是什么呢？Bushcraft提供了重新连接的方式，因为你使用你的双手。我们必须抓住机会与野生自然建立联系并保护它。

**问题3：全球人口问题。**
**观众 (持麦克风的女士):** 谢谢。我对全球人口增长的担忧？我听说统计学家说我们将从70亿增长到100亿。我们还没有解决这个问题。我在思考这是否是一个核心问题。

**雷·米尔斯:** 好的，我认为这被引为一个复杂的问题。对我来说，最高法院关于在达特穆尔野生露营的裁决，我告诉你，国家公园是为了让人们享用的，它们本身就是人们的奇妙、巨大的资源。当然，进入必须得到管理。通过达特穆尔……达特穆尔是一个奇妙的地方，充满了机会。其他时候可能不是这样。自由通行权是这些地方能够生存下去的原因，因为它是你的一部分。不是一个别人替你理解的地方。乡村需要那些与之有联系的人们。人们认为我们这些热爱达特穆尔的人不关心达特穆尔。那不是真的。如果不是我们，谁会站出来保护它呢？我想知道为什么这一点没有在所有地方得到理解？就像，是的，那关乎所有权。如果你感觉拥有它，你就会在事后照顾它。土地，寻找平衡。但更重要的是，是整个地球，这个我们不能在不理解自己在做什么的情况下就鲁莽行事的系统。在一些地方，因为例如骑自行车的人，不知不觉中造成了损害，因为他们不知道。不幸的是，我们如何管理这个？有时，因为这些地方很珍贵，进入受到限制。我在中国的野生地方看到了这一点，特殊的区域在更大的公园内被保护起来，以减少人类影响，所以只有护林员可以进入。这有助于自然。这很重要。我们需要保护它们。

**问题4：平衡能源需求和土地使用。**
**观众 (Justin):** Justin，在这儿。嗨，关于解决能源问题。在农田上，无论是用于粮食生产还是其他用途，关于我们乡村正在发生的事情，比如继续到处铺设太阳能电池板。一度，关于这些事情的讨论持续了多年，为了产生能源并解决这些问题。事情选址的问题，而不是仅仅是党派政治，那似乎才是方式。核能是一个选择，但是像稀土元素这样的材料从哪里获取？而且当我们购买它们时，它们是否在其他地方损害地球？我们必须记住这一点。在一些地区，有解决方案。我们有许多问题。氢能是另一个问题。它很容易生产。我们问了正确的问题吗？有人需要解决这些问题。我们试图使土地高产，但我们是否只是占用土地然后盲目前进？解决这个问题肯定很复杂。当你找到一个真正试图解决问题的方法时，我一直在观察，感觉在这方面没有太多进展。厌倦了左右翼的争论。这很重要。我们需要一个清晰的方法来提供解决方案。

**雷·米尔斯:** 嗯，问题是，你对英国的未来以及这种无稽的政治反应有何感受？随着时间的推移，这并没有帮助。未来需要我们问“为什么？” Bushcraft 的经验，我是根据经验这么说的，但它很奇妙。

**问题5：最喜欢的英国哺乳动物和物种重引。**
**观众:** 呃，我会问一个简短、好的问题。您的政治观点是什么？不，我的意思是您最喜欢的英国哺乳动物是什么，以及您对物种重引，比如獾，有什么看法？

**雷·米尔斯:** 是的。拿獾来说。令人惊讶的是如此多的人从未见过活的獾，这令人震惊。你会在路上看到它们死去的尸体。上次我在那个地区时，我看到了一只。有趣的是，观察它们随着时间的变化。我想……困难。那么，带回像恐狼这样的物种呢？我认为我们不应该带回已灭绝的物种。那不应该发生。嗯，这值得怀疑。那艘船已经驶离了。我们必须照顾好我们仍然拥有的东西，我们现有的野生动物。我看过一部纪录片，里面有1995年的镜头，当时狼被重新引入黄石公园。他们现在有800只受保护的狼，所以，嗯，内兹佩尔塞印第安人，该项目的某些赞助者，接受了那部纪录片的采访。他们说他们的部落与狼共存。他们捕食同样的猎物，但从未发生冲突。他们认为狼是同伴，是猎人。关于他们如何共存，有很多值得学习的地方。从他们那里，我们可以获得巨大的理解。

我确实有最喜欢的动物，毫无保留。我没有一个最喜欢的。或者也许我有。无论是什么，如果我错过了它，观众会纠正我，稍微。它们通常与某个慈善机构有关，给它们一些关注是很重要的。对于提高意识非常重要。你所能做的任何事情都值得赞赏。

**问题6：最受威胁的物种和个人情感联系。**
**观众:** 呃，不。在所有面临灭绝的物种中，您是否会特别提及或感觉与之有联系的物种？

**雷·米尔斯:** 对我来说，看着关键野生动物的减少，即使我只在电视上看到它们，也和亲眼所见一样令人痛心。犀牛。我几天前去看它们了。你与动物的联系，就像你和你父亲关于一只宠物的联系一样，当他说“不，绝对不行”时，然后它们成为了很棒的伴侣。一个男孩和他的狗，他们变得形影不离。而这些野生生物，是我们想要保护的。而它们的交易是荒谬的。一代人之后将无法看到它们。真的，但是穿山甲触动了我。嗯，它全身覆盖着鳞片。受到威胁时，它会蜷缩成一个球，像一个神秘的足球。冷酷无情的人认为它的鳞片有药用价值，但它们没有。它们正在被非法贩运。我们必须关心这些以及其他正在遭受苦难的动物。

在英国这里，就在我们家门口，你正在目睹衰退。例如，麦鸡，当你年轻时你看到很多，但现在仍然很少。我觉得这意义深远。在我50多岁的时候，我看到这种向下的趋势。你看到更多的损失。我们看到像白尾鹞这样的鸟带着翼标，这意味着它几乎被杀死，你知道的。时间在我们身边流逝。所以。我希望这种杀戮停止，那些仍然发生在我看来是一场悲剧。

**问题7：手机和社交媒体对青少年的影响。**
**观众:** 回到手机的话题，那很有趣。您如何看待它们的影响？

**雷·米尔斯:** 我经常被告知我的观点并不惊人。安全是一个担忧，但其潜力是惊人的。数据正在指数级增长。童年曾经与自行车有关，现在那个角色被手机取代了。那些应用程序占据了如此多的时间，它们令人上瘾。它们，实际上，你的孩子，一直沉迷于其中……因为无法摆脱它本身，它影响着我们。也许我的想法过时了。人们在社交媒体上使用滤镜，美化，扮演别人。你的工作可能会受到你发布内容的影响。现在很少有人对现实有广阔的视野。所以，话虽如此……最后一个问题。是一位女士的。不要再谈论滤镜了，它们可以廉价获得。认为你不会因此被捕是错误的。女士们，她们看起来端庄，但我们已经看到问题了。我是个老头子了。在英国有这样的事情发生。

**问题8：在英国重引猞猁或狼等捕食者。**
**观众:** 重引，重引像猞猁或狼这样的捕食者到英国？确保乡村不会太拥挤，考虑后果。

**雷·米尔斯:** 我更多地考虑和谐共处。金雕曾被毒害、迫害。我们需要一些改变。成年人，某人，某个地方需要行动。嗯，我们需要珍视我们拥有的这些动物。与社群对话，实际上是在基层，在这些问题真实存在的地方。

**问题9：个人爱好和具影响力的Bushcraft地点。**
**观众:** 哦，问题。嗨。您的个人活动、爱好是什么？与您对自然的热爱有某种联系吗？

**雷·米尔斯:** 那是雕刻勺子。 Bushcraft 对我来说是一种生活方式。说什么不是更简单。在我去过的所有地方中，对 Bushcraft 影响最大以及令人惊奇的，有许多地方。对我来说，是那些人们宽容的地方，那让地方变得特别。当局明智，法律允许你有分寸地做事。记住你对自然的热爱。呃，特殊的环境如沙漠。澳大利亚大部分地区都是如此。是原住民教会了我很多。那就是 Bushcraft 。通过那种方式，我成为了现在的我。与地球建立联系，那是一份礼物。

**问题10：遗产以及一个人去世后什么最重要。**
**观众:** 话题有点不吉利。白金汉宫，最后的安息之地？您希望为永恒留下什么话？

**雷·米尔斯:** 不，不。当你离开了，那不重要。你走了之后，什么是重要的，什么会继续存在，就像他们说的。

**问题11： Bushcraft 的真正含义。**
**观众 (Ray):** 嗨，Ray， Bushcraft 对您来说真正意味着什么？

**雷·米尔斯:** 哦，这就像让观众完全理解我所取得的成就。我无法用更高的赞美来形容。嗯，太频繁地，学生们只是在学习一项技能。我将用另一种声音来解释。嗯，事情很重要。就是这样。但是真正的机会是通过像加拿大这样的地方找到的。那些生活在那里的人们，因为他们的联系。我不能再强调了，就像我刚才说过的，通过这种直接的经验，在我们生活的那个钢筋水泥丛林中……我会说，一个简单的帆布帐篷就足以生活，那很棒。

**问题12：让年轻人摆脱电子产品，走进自然。**
**观众:** 所有，嗯，我们如何让年轻人摆脱电子产品走进自然？

**雷·米尔斯:** 我认为即使今天，一个孩子，如果他或她在外面玩耍，他们不需要太多。他们对电子产品的兴趣会减少吗？也许如果他们在外面。如果你和我在一起，我会关掉电子产品。很多时候，如果你与户外交流，你会发现奇妙的事物。

**问题13： Bushcraft 在环保主义和原住民知识中的作用。**
**观众:** 我的问题。嗯，所以，首先您提到，或者看起来确实中国人比其他国家在环境方面做得更好，无论如何。 Bushcraft 是如何被用来推广这一点的？而且，有人建议教授这些技能。 Bushcraft 。嗯，这些在多大程度上被采纳了？而且我还看到一些来自1970年代的东西，一个人在国家公园里穿着旧衣服。这时进来一个正在看一些关于地球的节目的人。我记得他的名字，一个像大卫·艾登堡那样的环保人物。嗯，在70年代， Bushcraft 更多的是直接接触自然，而不仅仅是观察。是时候我们开始回归那种方式并关心自然了，不仅仅是通过电视看到它，而是通过体验它来获得动力。工作巨大，但非常值得。

**问题14：战利品狩猎与自然保护。**
**观众:** 我们听到了您关于鹿的看法。哦，另一个问题。我对您关于战利品的看法很感兴趣。然而，狩猎能否为自然保护做出贡献？

**雷·米尔斯:** 复杂。有些地方进行狩猎，那里大多是在围栏后面，动物是为此而饲养的。坦白说，我并不赞同。你知道，但一些狩猎保护区依赖于此，当地社区也参与其中，因为他们想要收入。但是如果一个保护区没有资金，他们可能会失去整个保护区和动物。那种类型的狩猎，或者射杀一只牙齿磨损的老公象，更难辩护，但有些人认为这将为自然保护提供资金。所以，关键在于真正发生了什么。很少有简单的真相。我认为在不了解其在自然保护中作用的情况下禁止战利品，是有问题的。钱去了哪里？我认为在英国，当然，我们的捕食行为较少，所以猎人的角色不同。那只动物可能不得不饿死。复杂。所有自然保护主义者都知道他们正在处理复杂的问题。这是一个合理的问题。一个困难的话题，毫无疑问。嗯，我能说什么呢？

**问题15：最喜欢的品牌或工具。**
**观众:** 我没有更多问题了。比您回答了这么多问题，太棒了。您数了多少个？比如……哦，还有一个。嗯，当您在寻找能用的品牌或工具时，最好的建议是什么，您在寻找什么？真的，有特定的品牌还是别的什么？

**雷·米尔斯:** 也许我不能在不冒犯其他人的情况下说出某个特定品牌的东西。没有什么比实际使用工具的经验更重要了。它必须可靠，不会让你失望，这很重要。

**问题16：灵感来源。**
**观众:** 嗨，Ray，可能快结束了。我们讨论这个话题已经有一会儿了，但是我们能继续吗？我们有时间。继续吧。您好，您的灵感来源是谁？

**雷·米尔斯:** 我的灵感来源？我的母校老师启发了我。灵感可以来自很多地方。嗯，探险家如塞缪尔·赫恩。他是我敬佩的人。就像那样，这很重要。

**问题17：平衡农业与国家公园。**
**观众:** 我还有几个问题。您的持麦克风的团队快没力气了。我这里有一个。农田比如说在国家公园内的7000英亩。您对公园内这种土地使用有何看法？它应该生产粮食还是用于公园内野生动物的保护？

**雷·米尔斯:** 我可以稍后讨论这个问题。您的问题很好。

**问题18：最喜欢的削制作品。**
**观众:** 太棒了。而且说实话，您很棒。站起来回答最后一个关于您最喜欢的削制作品的问题。

**雷·米尔斯:** 哦。我最喜欢的削制作品。我已经忘记很多了。有人用木头做了花，你知道的。你可以雕刻很多东西。是的，削木很好。很棒。熟悉一些木材，看看你能用它做出什么，那实际上会变得非常令人满意。它是你几乎随处可见的东西。女士们先生们，请务必拥抱 Bushcraft 。非常感谢。

**结束语**

**雷·米尔斯:** 米尔斯，如果你想去帐篷那边签名。跟着我就行。

**Ray Mears on Bushcraft, Conservation, and Our Connection to the Natural World: A Q&A Session**

*The following is a transcribed and edited Q&A session where renowned bushcraft expert Ray Mears shares his insights on preparedness, the importance of nature, conservation challenges, and the core principles of bushcraft.*

**Opening Remarks & The Value of Experience**

**Ray Mears:** So, I ask that we can explore these questions. We try and delve into them. I just want to please the audience with answers.

**Ray Mears:** Yes, hello. And I really should address this because, in recent years, I’ve talked a lot about adversity and challenge. True skill and experience are often forged in such conditions. When you raise the subject of experience, a particular incident comes to mind.

I was dropped off in a small town in Spain. I had tied all my clobber – my gear – together for the airport. The potential for problems looked minimal. I checked the departure board, and the flight to London, then, was cancelled. And that's where you have to employ different stages of thinking. The critical thing was that it was the last flight out, so all accommodation was gone. You can't stay in the airport. Eventually, after about 10 hours in Spain, with my flight supposed to leave at 10:00 PM, I had to figure out where I was going to stay. I couldn't go to the airport; there was nowhere to go, and my transport had clearly gone away.

There were a number of things I couldn't do. I had no bank card or phone, as they were with my gear at the airport. I was off the road, without access to the motorway. I'd need help. The alternative was to swim or find another way of doing things, which would have been tough. But with a bit of polish and foresight, I found a solution. That night, I took a local bus down to a village that looked like it might offer free or cheap accommodation. It was an adventure, and it all worked out. The foresight, though, was key. I always travel prepared for the unexpected. What if somebody had become hypothermic? It was an adventure, yes, but it reinforced the wisdom of being prepared.

This experience, and many others, has reinforced the wisdom of preparation over time.

**On Essential Kit and Common Mistakes**

**Ray Mears:** And actually, I'm often asked about rare and common mistakes. Many beautiful, stunning places, you know, can present challenges. People wear t-shirts, influenced by small factors, but they don't consider the implications. And trainers! What trousers are they wearing? Do they have insect repellent? Could there be a better way to approach that? Your smiling face tells me my point is understood. Something else made my life easy: I won't go into serious detail, but that's important. Guides often reiterate that. Indeed.

So, you head out, and the forecast is fine, but you've got to consider all possibilities based on that experience. We've seen people get into trouble because they haven't packed waterproofs. They make that mistake with friends. You see this heavy reliance on good weather. How is your judgment? And always respect the elements. Always. It's what you need.

**Bushcraft: Skills, Mindfulness, and Community**

**Ray Mears:** That’s too simplistic. Actually, when you come to bushcraft, you learn what you need. In essence, that's what people gain. When we teach bushcraft, that’s what it is. Bushcraft, within its framework, enables you to be prepared for adventure. And to be honest, you shouldn't have to fall back on it, you know, if you plan. For a long time, the people who didn't organize their trips well were the ones who needed it most.

I was in Spain, and an interesting situation arose regarding cold weather, because I was also thinking about the Philippines. So, we talk about skills like carving spoons. That helps build, I think, critical thinking. Um, it’s a mistake many have made over the years. What you do with your kit – that jacket, for example, offers protection, whatever the situation. Always carry it. You can't do without it. When you're practicing bushcraft, even if you don't go far, perhaps just in your garden with sticks, it’s important too.

Mindfulness and bushcraft have become intertwined, though it wasn't always called that. Interestingly, in a difficult situation in another country, nobody went into panic. It was all resolved within minutes. A difficult drive would have been harder for somebody else. The thing you learn with bushcraft will help you to a degree. It's an attitude, a brotherhood. This is something bigger. And fear can become manageable. Self-reliance is what their experiences teach. When we teach bushcraft, they're not just people concerned about their own needs, but about others. We will see rapid development in the community. The willingness to help in the world is not always present, but it is important. If you think something is dangerous, it’s not always so. That skill that boils down to using compasses, these things… Invest time in learning because knowledge is all around us. To get proper training is very important.

Over the years, people have viewed bushcraft enthusiasts as lunatics. We mean to show that every year, the human connection to nature is vital. It’s as good for us as anything. I think the path to understanding nature will not be beaten. I believe the elder generations understood that. Many things are made clear through nature. A lot of something positive comes from it.

**National Identity and Global Environmental Challenges**

**Ray Mears:** The Commonwealth, a few nations. One, Finland, has a self-deprecating humor. The Finnish concept of 'sisu' is about resilience. I think it’s a message for every nation. The target is withstanding challenges. And the world, politics, issues… nature itself faces challenges on this planet.

If we don't act soon… The Earth’s surface is all we’ve got. Together, we need to use thin common sense. That means understanding that you're using finite resources. If you cut them down, you affect the future. These resources for the planet are vital. It is important that what we pass on, others would also appreciate. I tell you, this is the problem: We're often too slow. Maybe we exploit resources, and in doing so, cause damage. A most important thing is to take responsibility. And because learning about nature touches you inside, it helps to get the message across that what some spout is actually nonsense. The truth lies with the environment. During lockdown, after lockdown, the countryside was flooded with people wanting to touch nature. Now that access is maybe being restricted. This is a concern. This access to the countryside. Why? It’s so important.

We in bushcraft have an important message about this. At a certain point, I said, this is what I stand for. And those in the thick of it, messing with their environment are missing the point. And the real joy is being involved with the natural world and I think you can be true to yourself, build a strong community. Thank you.

**Q&A Session Begins**

**Host:** Thank you. Any questions? Um, if you've got one, I'll bring a microphone. If you just wait for the microphones, that's best.

**Question 1: On the healing power of nature and traditional knowledge.**
**Audience Member:** Thank you. In terms of healing, um, and collecting natural materials/knowledge. Do you, um, see these that are happening in the world affecting this?

**Ray Mears:** Right. Interesting things are happening. My focus would be with traditional knowledge. There's a pointed need for hands-on learning that gets you to remember. I remember seeing… I'll tell you a fact, uh, it struck me massively. There is evidence that we're warming at an alarming rate. For example, recently, uh, I learned why it's so cold in some places, yet overall warming is occurring. Just the sheer scale. The, the levels of ice melting over the years, it's staggering. We're losing tons per hour. Young people in Greenland… And, um, those who depend on the ice, like hunters, a whole way of life for men, is disappearing. Having them understand the problem is crucial. Annually, 0.1% of ice melt from South Greenland, along with ice melt from Australia, means areas are under threat of water coming. Uh, what can be done when people have to move because they're losing their land? To be clear, these things have always been happening, but not at this rate. Those areas are just threatened. New York is threatened. People are going to be affected, but they don't realize it. The problems are growing exponentially, faster. The fires, all linked to climate. This affects us. It’s a global issue.

**Question 2: Geopolitical obstacles to addressing planetary issues.**
**Audience Member (Rich):** Uh, Rich. Thank you for the talk on many aspects. You talk about the planet and the geopolitics, the obstacles. The interface between people and nature, I feel is very important. The situation with China, an, um, example of this. It seems that solutions are right there, but not implemented. We have to start from today.

**Ray Mears:** And they love nature, but this disconnects people from nature. Of course, things like wood carvings have been around for years, not just as special items, but as part of life. We will see in a few years our children... Who are they? What will you show them? Look at that tree. The national parks, the formations, the cliffs. What is nature if not part of ourselves? Bushcraft offers ways to reconnect because you use your hands. We must seize the opportunity to connect with the wild and protect it.

**Question 3: Global population concerns.**
**Audience Member (Lady with microphone):** Thank you. My concerns about population growth globally? I've heard statisticians say we're going from 7 billion to 10 billion. We haven't addressed this. I'm wondering about this as a core thing.

**Ray Mears:** Okay, I think this was introduced as a complicated question. For me, the Supreme Court ruling on wild camping on Dartmoor, I tell you, National Parks are there to be enjoyed, they are wonderful, immense resources for people themselves. Of course, access must be managed. Through Dartmoor… Dartmoor is a wonderful place with opportunities. Other times it may not be. The right to roam is the reason these places will survive, because it's part of you. Not a place someone else understands for you. The countryside needs people who have a connection to it. People think we who love Dartmoor don't care about Dartmoor. That isn't true. Who'd stand up for it if not us? I wonder why this isn't understood everywhere? Like, yeah, that's about ownership. If you feel ownership, you take care of it after yourself. The land, finding balance. But more than that, it's the whole Earth, the system where we can't just blunder through without understanding what we're doing. On some places, because of cyclists for example, unwittingly, damage was done because they didn't know. Unfortunately, how do we manage this? Sometimes, because these places are precious, access is restricted. I saw this with wild places in China, special areas are preserved within larger parks to protect human impact, so only rangers can go there. And this helps nature. It's important. We need to protect them.

**Question 4: Balancing energy needs and land use.**
**Audience Member (Justin):** Justin, here. Hi, regarding tackling energy issues. On farmland, whether for food production or other uses, about what's happening in our countryside, like going ahead and putting solar panels everywhere. At one point, there were discussions about these things for years, to generate energy and address these matters. The issue of where things were sited, rather than just party politics, that seemed to be the way. Nuclear is an option, but where are the materials like rare earth elements sourced? And when we buy them, are they damaging the earth elsewhere? We have to keep this in mind. In some areas, there are solutions. We have many issues. Hydrogen is another issue. It's easily produced. Do we ask the right questions? Somebody needs to address these issues. We're trying to make land productive, but are we just taking land and going forward without thought? Surely tackling this is complicated. When you find a way that is really trying to solve the problem, I have been watching and it feels like not much is happening on this front. Fed up with the left and right debate. It's important. And we need a clear way to give solutions.

**Ray Mears:** Um, the point is, what you feel about the future of Britain and this kind of nonsense political reaction? Over time, it’s not helpful. The future needs us to ask "Why?" The bushcraft experience, and I say this from experience, but it's wonderful.

**Question 5: Favorite UK mammal and reintroductions.**
**Audience Member:** Uh, I'll ask a quick, good one. Where's, where is your political view on this? No, I mean what's your favorite UK mammal, and what are your thoughts on reintroductions, like the badger?

**Ray Mears:** Yeah. Take the badger. It's amazing that so many people have never seen one alive, it's staggering. You see them dead on the road. Last time I was in the area, I saw one. What is interesting, it is, to watch them over time. I think… difficult. What about bringing back something like a direwolf? I don't think we should bring back extinct species. That shouldn't happen. Um, it's questionable. That ship has sailed. We've got to look after that which we still have, our existing wildlife. A documentary I saw had footage from 1995, when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone. They now have 800 wolves under protection, so, um, the Nez Perce Native Americans, certain sponsors of the program, were interviewed for that program. They said their nation lived alongside wolves. They ate the same prey, but were never in conflict. They thought of the wolf as a fellow wolf, a hunter. There's a lot to learn about how they coexisted. From them, we can acquire massive understanding.

I've got a favorite animal, without reservation. I don't have one favorite. Or maybe I do. Whatever it is, if I miss it, the audience will correct me, slightly. They're often linked to a charity, and it's important to give them a slice of attention. Very important for raising awareness. Anything you can do is appreciated.

**Question 6: Most threatened species and personal connection.**
**Audience Member:** Uh, no. Out of all species facing extinction, is there one you would particularly mention or feel a connection to?

**Ray Mears:** For me, watching the decline of key wildlife, even if I only see them on television, it's the same as seeing it firsthand. Rhinoceros. I went to see them some days ago. Your connection to an animal, like the one you had with your dad about a pet, when he is saying "No, absolutely not," and then they become wonderful companions. A boy and his dog, where they become inseparable. And these wild creatures, are ones we want to protect. And the trade in them is ridiculous. A generation from now will not have seen them. Really, but the pangolin touches me. Um, it is covered in scales. It curls into a ball when threatened, like a secretive football. Callous people feel its scales have medicinal properties, but they don't. They're being illegally trafficked. We must care for these and others that are suffering.

Here in the UK, on our doorstep, you're seeing decline. The lapwing, for example, when you were young you saw many, but now still few. I find that profound. In my 50s, I see this downward slope. You see more loss. And we see birds like the hen harrier with a wing tag, meaning it was nearly killed, you know. Time is running around us. So. And I would like the killing to stop, that which is still happening to me is a tragedy.

**Question 7: Impact of mobile phones and social media on youth.**
**Audience Member:** Going back to phones, that's interesting. How do you view their impact?

**Ray Mears:** I'm often told my views are not amazing. Safety is a concern, but the potential is astonishing. Data is growing exponentially. Childhood used to involve a bicycle, now that role is taken by phones. The apps take up so much time, they're addictive. Them, actually, your children, being on them all the time… because there's no escape from itself, it affects us. Maybe I'm old-fashioned in my mind. People use fillers on social media, on enhancements, being someone else. Jobs can be affected by what you post. Very few people have a wide view of reality anymore. So, with that said… Last question. It was one of the ladies. No more on fillers, they're available cheaply. Wrong to assume that you can't be arrested. Ladies, they appear demurely, but we've seen issues. I am an old man. There are things like this happening in the UK.

**Question 8: Reintroduction of predators like lynx or wolves in the UK.**
**Audience Member:** Reintroduce, reintroduced predators like lynx or wolves to the UK? Make sure the countryside isn't too crowded, consider the consequences.

**Ray Mears:** I think more about living in harmony. Golden eagles were poisoned, persecuted. We need something to change. Grown people, somebody, somewhere needs to act. Um, we need to value these animals we have. Talk to Communities, actually on the ground, where these issues are real.

**Question 9: Personal hobbies and influential bushcraft locations.**
**Audience Member:** Oh, questions. Hi. What are your personal activities, hobbies? Somehow with your love for nature?

**Ray Mears:** That's carving spoons. Bushcraft for me is a way of life. More easy to say what isn't. Out of all the places I've been, the most influential for bushcraft and what is amazing, so many places are. It is, to me, where people are tolerant, that makes places special. Authorities being sensible, the law allowing you to do things respectfully. Remember your love of nature. Uh, special environments like the desert. Much of Australia is like that. It was the Aboriginal people who showed me so much. That's bushcraft. In that way, I have become who I am. Be connected to the earth, it's a gift.

**Question 10: Legacy and what's important after one is gone.**
**Audience Member:** Subject is a bit morbid. Buckham Palace, a final resting place? What would you want said for eternity?

**Ray Mears:** No, no. When you're off, it doesn't matter. What is important when you're gone, what's left on, as they're saying.

**Question 11: What bushcraft truly means.**
**Audience Member (Ray):** Hi Ray, what does bushcraft truly mean to you?

**Ray Mears:** Oh, this is like bringing the audience to a full set of understanding what I've achieved. I can't tell you any higher compliment. Um, too often, are students just learning a skill. I'm going to use an other voice to explain. Um, things are important. That is it. But the true opportunity is found through places like Canada. People that live there, because of their connection. And I can't stress enough, as I said a little while ago, through this direct experience, in that concrete jungle we live with… And I'll say, a simple canvas tent would be enough to live, and that's brilliant.

**Question 12: Getting young people off electronics and into nature.**
**Audience Member:** All, um, how do we get young people off electronics and into nature?

**Ray Mears:** I think even today, a child, if he or she played outside, they don't need much. Would they be less inclined to electronics? Maybe if they're outside. I would switch off electronics if you are with me. Very often, you find wonderful things in the outdoors if you communicate with it.

**Question 13: Bushcraft's role in environmentalism and indigenous knowledge.**
**Audience Member:** My question. Um, so, first of all, you mentioned, or it does seem that the Chinese are doing better for the environment than other nations, whatever. How has bushcraft been used to promote this? And, it's been suggested to teach these skills. Bushcraft. Um, to what extent are these being adopted? And I also saw something from the 1970s, a person in a national park wearing old clothes. Into this scene comes someone who is watching some program about the earth. I remember his name, a conservation figure like David Attenborough. Um, in the 70s, bushcraft was about contacting nature more directly than just observing. It's about time we started turning back to that and caring, motivated by more than just seeing it on TV, but by experiencing it. Huge, but well worth it.

**Question 14: Trophy hunting and conservation.**
**Audience Member:** We've heard what you said about deer. Oh, another question. I'm interested in your view on trophies. However, can hunting contribute to conservation?

**Ray Mears:** Complicated. You have places where hunting occurs, where it's mostly behind a fence, the animals are bred for it. Quietly, I don't agree with that. You know, but some game reserves rely on it, and local communities go along because they want the income. But if a reserve doesn't have funding, they could lose the whole reserve and the animals. Of that type of hunting, or shooting an old bull elephant with worn teeth, it becomes harder to justify, but some argue it will fund conservation. And so, it's about what's really happening. There's rarely a simple truth. I think banning trophies without understanding the role in conservation, is problematic. Where does the money go? I think in Britain, of course, we have less predation so the hunter's role is different. That animal might have to starve. Complicated. All Conservationists know they're dealing with complicated issues. It’s a valid question. A difficult subject, most definitely. Well, what can I say?

**Question 15: Favorite brands or tools.**
**Audience Member:** No more questions from me. Than you for answering so many, amazing. How many have you counted? Like… Oh, got another one. Um, what's the best advice when you're looking for brands or tools that work, what are you looking for? Really, are there specific brands or just something else?

**Ray Mears:** Maybe I can't name a specific brand for something without offending somebody else. Nothing beats experience with the tool. It's important that it won't let you out down.

**Question 16: Inspirations.**
**Audience Member:** Hi Ray, probably coming to the end. We've been on the subject for a while, but can we go on? We've got time. Go on. Hello, who are your inspirations?

**Ray Mears:** My inspirations? My old school teacher set me off. Inspiration can come from many places. Um, explorers like Samuel Hearne. He was someone I looked up to. Like that, it's important.

**Question 17: Balancing agriculture and national parks.**
**Audience Member:** I have a couple more. Your team with the microphone is running out of steam. I have one here. Agricultural land, say 7,000 acres within a national park. And what are your thoughts about this kind of land use within a park? Should it produce food or be for protection of wildlife in the park?

**Ray Mears:** I can discuss this later. Your question is good.

**Question 18: Favorite whittled item.**
**Audience Member:** Brilliant. And actually, you are brilliant. Stand up for one last question about your favorite whittled item.

**Ray Mears:** Oo. My favorite thing I've whittled. I've forgotten many. And somebody's made a wooden flower, you know. You can carve many things. Yeah, whittling is good. Lovely. To become familiar with some wood, and see what you can make with it, that can become actually very satisfying. It is something that's accessible to you just about anywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, absolutely embrace bushcraft. Thank you very much.

**Closing Remarks**

**Ray Mears:** Mears, if you want to make your way to the tent for signing. Just follow me.
