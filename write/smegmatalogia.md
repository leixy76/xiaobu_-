## TO THE HONOURABLE,

The Society for Improving of AGRICULTURE and MANUFACTURES in SCOTLAND.

GENTLEMEN, 

Know not to whom an Essay of this Nature could be more properly inscribed, than to you, who have rendered yourselves so conspicuous in that excellent and laudable Undertaking of Improving of AGRICULTURE and MANUFACTURES; and altho' you have not assumed to yourselves, such an illustrious Name as that of ROYAL SOCIETY, which hath added so many Honours and Profits to our neighbouring Country, by their great Discoveries and Improvements in natural and experimental Knowledge, yet your Undertakings intitle you to all the just Praise and Honours your Country can bestow upon you; and, however mean AGRICULTURE may appear in the Hands of the Husbandman, yet is there in it a spacious Field for Contemplation and Improvement in natural Philosophy.

THE Loss this Country hath sustained, by the too long Neglect of useful Improvements in AGRICULTURE and MANUFACTURES, is too obvious to need more than barely mentioning; The early Improvements of our neighbouring Country, shews us a noble Example, worthy of a diligent Imitation; and the Profits and Consequences of such Improvements, both to the Tenant and Landlord, are so manifest a Demonstration of the Usefulness of them, equal to the strictest mathematical ones.

I have taken the greatest Pains I am capable of, to render this Book as useful as possible: My Directions are plain and easy: I have not affected the florid Style, thinking, the plainer Things of this Nature are laid down, the better and easier they will be understood and observed; and if the Directions I have given be exactly followed, and duly put in Practice, I hope it will make good what I promised in my PROPOSALS, Viz, That this Book will be very useful to all, bringing not only Profit to the Tenant, but thereby making the Landlord get his Rent better paid: and nothing can better recommend it to the Practice of our Country, than your Approbation and Patronage; which will tend to the Profit and Pleasure of those that put in Practice this ESSAY, and be an Honour and very great Satisfaction to him, who is,

GENTLEMEN; 
With all humble and sincere Respect,
Your most obedient and devoted Servant
JAMES DUNBAR.

## DIRECTIONS for BURNING, and how to use all the Vegetables that are proper for making POTASHES and SOAP

THE Vegetables useful for all those Purposes, are Oak, Ash, Beech, Thorn, Juniper Trees, and Whins.

The Herbs are Fern or Bracken, Wormwood, Nettles, Thistles, Stinking Weed, and such like.

The Sea-Weed, or Ware, whereof they make Kelp, is used in making White Soap, but the Way of burning it being so well known in the Country, I need not treat thereof. Kelp and the Hemlock are fitter for Glass-Works than White Soap; but the Scarcity of the other Vegetables, at present, and the Cheapness of Kelp, makes it to be used; tho, were the other Vegetables in Plenty, it would not be so much used in White Soap, because the other Vegetables make better Soap without it. 


### Burning Wood Ashes

As to the burning of the Vegetables, Oak, Ash, Beech and Thorn, are burnt the same Way, to wit, Take to an empty or waste House, the green Twigs, and kindle them with a small Fire of Whins or Bracken, and feed your Fire continually till you have a Quantity of them; they must be carefully kept from Wind and Rain, for Rain destroys the Salts, and Wind blows off the Ashes; then, when the Ashes are cold, they must be sifted and put in Barrels, or in a Loft, well packed, Which will preserve their Salts.

THE Juniper and Whins must be burnt with a deal of Care, because they flame, which may endanger the House where they are burnt: They may be burnt in the Field, in calm Weather, near a Hut or a House, wherein they may be put at Night, in case of Rain or Wind; and because they will be hot after burning, carry them to the Hut or House, in an Ash-Board, and they will burn for several Days, which will make the Ashes the finer and better; then sift and pack them as aforesaid.

### Burning Ferns or Bracken

THE Ferns or Bracken are burnt in the Field; they must be cut green, in the Months of July and August, and will be better if stalked 8 or 10 Days before they are burnt, so that they heat and sweat, and you may have more Salts.

BUT tho' you burn them when new cut, (if the Weather be hazardous) you will have good Salt, if Care be taken in burning of them.

THE Way of kindling them: Take a piece of burning Peat or Coal, about the Bigness of your Fist, and lay on it a Handful or Two of dry Bracken, blow them up so that they kindle, and lay on Bracken by Degrees, and you will soon have a Fire; Continue this till you lay on a Cart Load or Two, but you must take Care they do not flame; in that Case, throw on more Bracken where the Flame is, or beat it down with Sticks or Dung Fork.

WHEN your Fire is near burnt down, you must stir it up from the Bottom, till that which lies in the Heart, or otherwise, be burnt black, then stir them up frequently till they turn white; afterwards you may augment the Fire upon the same Heap, and burn on so long as you have Day's Light; if the Wind blows too much, make a Sconce of Bracken to the Windward, to prevent the Ashes blowing away: If there come a deal of Rain, you must house or shut them with the Ash-Board; if it be small Rain, or flying Showers, throw dry Bracken on the Fire, Which will defend it; if you burn more than one Day, house every Day's burning at Night; and, being put all in a Heap, they will burn themselves for some Days, till they all turn white, and be sure they be turned twice or thrice a Day, from the Bottom to the Top, and they will be the whiter; then, when they are cold, sift and barrel them as the Wood Ashes.

**Nota,** In good Weather, you may burn Day and Night, and ten Men can keep three Fires.

### Burning Other Herbs and Weeds

THE other Herbs or Weeds, particularly the Wormwood, must be dried before it be burnt, and you may raise a Fire of them with Ferns or Whins. Hemlock and the Stinking Weed are burnt after the same Manner; but for the Nettle and Thistle, you may throw them on either of the said Fires, and their Ashes will incorporate with the other; they must all of them be well burnt, that none of the earthy Part remain, and sift and pack them as aforesaid.

**Nota,** They may be burnt either in House or Field; and all Vegetables whatsoever must be burnt Green.

## The Way and Manner of making POTASHES of Scots Vegetables

THE Reason that we make not Potashes in Scotland, is the Scarcity of the Vegetables, there being no great Quantities of them in one Place; so that it cannot be expected we can have any large Potash-Work here; however, we may have such little Potash-Works as may serve ourselves, and may answer as well as the large; Majus & minus non variant in specie.

THE Reason of making Potashes in the Country where they are made, is because they have not Consumption at Home for the Lees of their Ashes, and it would be five Times greater Expence to export Ashes than Potashes, seeing it takes about five or six Hogsheads of common Ashes to make one of Potashes, and about four Hogsheads of common Ashes to make one of Pearl-Ashes. They can get Eight Shillings the Boll for Ashes in Scotland, and Four Shillings the Bushel in London; and this they make in an idle Time of Year, when they have no Work, viz. July and August, and if they should but make a Peck of them, they have ready Money for it; so here there is Money for nothing, and no Expence, but cutting and burning; and they labour a whole Year, by Servant and Horse, &c. in plowing and dunging, and cannot get above Ten Shillings, communibus annis, for a Boll of Victual, and here, for little or no Expence, (only a little Trouble) they have Eight Shillings the Boll; besides, by the early cutting of the Fern, they will have more and better Grass for their Cattle.

MY Design here, is only to instruct the Country-Man to make such a Quantity of Potashes as may serve himself for Bleaching his own Linen Cloth, and washing and scouring his Woollen and Linen Cloth. 


### Method of Making Potashes

TAKE twenty Pound Weight of burnt unslackened Lime Stone; lay it on a clear Earthen Floor, and lay above it one hundred Weight of Fern Ashes, in one Heap, so that the Lime Stone be covered, and throw on two or three Pints of Water, till the Ashes smoke; if the Lime-Stone be hard, or long of breaking, or slow, let the Water be warm; and when the Lime smoke, you may throw in upon the Heap, 30 or 40 Pound Weight of more Ashes; then you most have a Tub, with a small Hole in the Bottom of it, wherein you must put a Cork or Spigot in the under End, so you may draw it when you have occasion for it, and the Whole within must be covered with Straw to hinder the Ashes from coming through it; or you may make use of Wickers, and then you need not use Cork. 


THROW in Lime-Stone and Ashes in the Tub or Fat, let not the Lime-Stone lie all in one Place, but let them be all covered and mixed with Ashes; get two or three Handfuls of Straw twisted together, and put above the Ashes, in the Centre of the Tub or Fat; then pour on warm or cold Water, by Degrees, on the Straw, till you have a sufficient Quantity of Water to cover the Ashes. Let the Water stand four Hours upon the Ashes, then take out your Cork or Tap, and have a Tub below, to receive the Lee that comes off; and as you draw off the Lee, put in fresh Water as your Occasion requires; and if the Lee carries an Egg on the Surface of it, it is strong, and when it does not do that, you must boil it up to that Strength as to carry an Egg; then take of the Ashes of Ash, Beech, or Fern, and put them on the Backside of a Griddle, or Fire, and burn them till they turn white and green, and infuse them in a Pot, two Parts full of Lee boiling on the Fire, till they boil up to the Thickness of Pottage; then let it cool, and make them up in Balls; and if you have not a Furnace, put them in an Oven, when it is very hot, and let them stay there as long as the Oven is hot; or, if you have not an Oven, put the Balls in a hot Fire, till they burn all through; then, when they are cold, put them in a Barrel, and keep them close and dry, and they will be fit either for Bleaching, or making Soap, if your Lee was strong. 


BUT my Opinion is, That if the Lee be strong, and boiled up with the Ashes aforesaid, you may preserve them a Year in a Water-Can, well corked, or the Mouth of it kept very close, and they will be as good as any that are calcined or burnt in a Furnace, Oven, or Fire, and will bleach, or make Soap, as well as any other Kind of Ashes: For, if the Lee be preserved in its Saltness, all the Virtue lies there: And strong Lee can be preserved in a Water-Can better than in a Barrel: Besides, two or three Water-Cans will hold as much Lee or Potashes, made after the Manner aforesaid, as will serve any ordinary Country-Man for bleaching, or making of Soap for washing his Linen.

**Nota.** That you may make less or more of Potashes, or Lee, and Proportion them as above.

## DIRECTIONS for making WHITE SOAP

TAKE of the Lee of Fern-Ashes five Pints, and four Pounds Weight of good refined Tallow; dissolve in a Pot the Tallow in the Lee: Let your Pot be but two Parts of three full; because, if otherwise, it will swell and boil over; when it comes to the Boil, you must take Care to keep a slow Fire at it, and with a thin Piece of Stick, about two Inches broad, and ten or twelve Inches long, make it small at the End, and throw the Scummings off the Top into the boiling Part of it: Let it boil four Hours, then take off your Pot and let it cool, and take away the under Part of the Lee, and keep the Thick of the Pot; then fill up your Pot as before, with fresh Lee, and set it a boiling again upon a slow Fire for two Hours; then, as your Pot boils down, put in more Lee, and boil it for four Hours more. 


TASTE the Scum of the Pot, and see if it be salt, and thicken on the Stick like Wax; and throw in a Handful of White Salt in the Pot, When it is about two Hours boiled for the second Time: When you find It turn to Soap, as you will see by the Scum on the Top, and it being thick, 


let your Pot cool a little, but not over cool, then you must take a Box, unfixed at the Bottom, two Inches high at the Sides and Ends, and fifteen Inches long, eight Inches broad; and put a Linen Cloth in the Box, as Close to the Sides and Bottom as you can, then take a thin Cup, and scum your Soap off the Top, and put it in the Box till it cools: And if you design to make your Soap with Spearmint Scent, take a little Spearmint Water, and boil them together, and pour it on your Soap when it is fully cool, and with a small Stick, stir it from End to End, and Side to Side, and the Blue will incorporate in it: A Drop Weight of Indigo will serve 100 Weight of Soap. If you have not Spearmint Water, take a little of the Scum of the Pot, about two Drops Weight; and mix it with a little Water, till it froth, and incorporate with the Water, then put in your Indigo, and boil and mix it up as aforesaid. 


SPEARMINT-Water gives the Soap a good Smell; and the Indigo does no good to the Soap, but beautifies it. A Country-Man, who makes but a small Quantity for his own Use, may keep his Soap in a four Square Mass, after it comes out of the Box; but if he designs to have it in Wedges, he must cut it with a Silk Thread, or any other strong small Thread. If any makes great Quantities, he must Proportion the Tallow and Lee as above; and if he makes a great Quantity, he must have a large Boiler with a Crib in it, and a Brass Cock at the Bottom of it, to let out the Lees, when the Salt is taken out of them by the Boiling; for, in great Boilings, they take out the Lee at the Bottom, and do not let the Boiler cool, but add more Lees, and keep it always slowly boiling, till their Soap be made; and they have commonly, in great Works, two Caves and two Receivers, which are great Fats and Tubs for draining the Lee from the Ashes 


and Kelp. They make Use of Kelp, because it is a great deal cheaper than the Ashes: But they will have better Soap with the Ashes, when they have Plenty of them, than with Kelp and Ashes mixed together. They have likewise a large Box, all of loose Joints, for the cutting of the Soap in Wedges, after it is cool, and a large Soap-Sheet, that covers the upper Part of the Soap, as well as the Bottom, when the Soap is warm in the Box: So a little Practice will make any Man make White Soap. And boiling well with the Lee brings the Soap better to Perfection: So that a Country-Man, who has his own Pot and Materials, may make Soap to wash and bleach his own Cloth and Linen.

## BLEACHING OF CLOTH, with an Account of the Materials fit for it

IT is not to be expected, that I am to instruct those in the great Bleaching-Fields, who have Encouragement from the Government, and otherwise; for they are Masters enough of their Trade, without my Instruction, and have sufficient Profit in carrying on their Business, which is a Thing new in this Country, and few that understand it.

MY Design is for the Good of the Country in general, and, in particular, that the Farmer shall bleach his Cloth, for the most Part, with Scots Materials; which will not only save Money to the Country, but, in Time, bring it in. 


THE Irish, when they at first began the Bleaching-Trade, had Encouragement from the Government, (as we have now) but these great Bleach-Yards was not all their Benefit, for they had a Premium likewise for Yarn; and the then Undertakers were Men of great Stocks, and valued more the Trading than the Bleaching, because they had more Profit by the first than the last; for their profit from the Country, for Bleaching, was nothing in Comparison of What they had by their Spinning and Weaving; for they had many Poor, whom they supported by their Manufactures; Hence Bleaching was not made a great Mystery amongst them, for the Commons got all into it very soon, they being an industrious and cunning People. And at this Day they make their own Ashes, Potashes, and White Soap, and bleach Yarn and Linen, which is a great Advantage to the Country and the Manufactures too, their Poor being always employed, by the Consumption being so great, tho' they were as backward to these Improvements, at first, as we are at present: But it is hoped, in Time, that our Country will be as forward in these Things as the Irish are now, by the good Encouragement they have from the Government. 


IT is needless to me to insist upon the Advantages that will accrue to Scotland by our right bleaching of Yarn and Linen Cloth, or the bad Method we had of bleaching formerly, and the wrong Materials we used in bleaching, seeing it is sufficiently detected by the Honourable Society of Agriculture, and a fine Way of Bleaching set out by them, upon their proper Charges, for the Benefit of the Public, entitled, Directions for propagating, and dressing Lint and Hemp, Bleaching, &c. now to be sold by Alexander Davidson Bookseller in the Parliament-House.

### Equipment Needed for Bleaching

TO bleach Yarn or Linen Cloth, any Countryman who has but two or three Webs, or thereby, need not have those great Utensils that the great Bleach-Fields have, nor so many Servants or Attendants.

HE must have a large Settling Pot; no Brass or Copper Vessels are fit for the Purpose, because the Rust of them is of a corroding Nature, so that it eats or taints the Colour of the Yarn and Cloth. Four Tubs, with a Hogshead or two, a Barrel or Two, will serve the Bleaching, if it be not above seven or eight Pieces of Cloth.

## DIRECTIONS for BLEACHING of LINEN-YARN

YOU must spread out four or five Hanks at a Time, in the Bottom of your Tub, and lay four or five Hanks more across the Tub, and so on till your Tub be Half full; then throw in your cold Water gently, (lest the Yarn should shift) till the Tub be full. Let the Water stand for six Hours; After that let it run out by a Cock and Pail near the Bottom of the Tub, or a Hole in the Bottom of the Tub, that you may have a Cork in, and then draw it out until you empty your Tub of the first Water; after that, the Yarn must be taken out of the Tub; strain the Yarn thro' your Hands as well as you can, for it must not be beat or rubbed; otherwise it will make the Yarn fret and cotton; you must continue steeping your Yarn, and straining it thro' your Hands, till the Water is as clean and clear as when you at first put it in; then take your Yarn out of the Tub, and rinse it well in clean Water, then lay it out upon the Green to dry; and, when it is perfectly dry, you are to buck it with the Lee of Fern-Ashes, as prepared in my former Treatise upon Potashes. Your Lee must be so strong, as to carry an Egg half 


above the Surface of it; you must dip three or four Hanks, at a Time, amongst your cold Lee, and continue so laying them across, after dipping, till your Tub be Half full of Yarn, laying them in the Tub in the most equal and evenly Manner possible; they must not be pressed, lest it hinder the Lee to penetrate thro; after four Hours in the Buck, you must warm some of the Remainder of the Lee you dipt it in, and pour it on gently thro all the Tub; you must take Care your Lee be not too Warm, and put it in the Pot, but let it not boil; then pour it on the Yarn again in small Quantities, and let it stay there for two Hours more; you must continue throwing warm Lee on the Yarn, and, when it cools, throw it in the Pot again, and let it still be warm, and throw the warm Lee on the Yarn for the Space of three Hours; 


so, if your Lee be strong, your Yarn will be of a yellow Colour, tho' there's a vast Difference in Flax or Lint. When your Yarn is thus bucked, take it out and rinse it in cold Water, and strain two Hanks thro' your Hand at a Time, because tramping may fret the Yarn, if it be not well spun; then lay out your Yarn to the Green for two or three Days, still watering it, and let it not become dry; turn it every twenty four Hours, that both Sides may be equally bleached. The Design of thus bleaching of Yarn, is to carry off the Filth from it, and strengthen it for the Weaving.

**Nota** That no Cambrick or Lawn Yarns are to be bleached.

## Bleaching Linen Cloth

WHEN you bleach your Linen Cloth, you must have a Piece of level Grass, near a Rivulet, or Water-Side, or Springs, exposed to the Sun; three or four Tubs will serve you; and a large Pot, with a Hogshead for holding hot Water in, are the most Part of the Utensils fit for a Countryman to use, for he is not to undertake a great Bleach-Field. 


### Initial Washing

THE first Work is, to wash the new woven Cloth with warm Water and White Soap, using the warm Water and Soap twice or thrice, till such Time as he takes out all the Filth and Stuff, which the Weavers put on the Cloth when weaving, to wit, Size and Oil; which penetrate so, that cold Water cannot take it out; and when the warm Water and Soap have taken out all the foul Stuff, take out your Cloth and put it into a running Water, holding it by the one End; and let the other End run out its Length; (if you have that Conveniency) and toss it up and down in the Water by the End in your Hand, for Half an Hour and longer, till such Time as the Soap be washed out; and if you have not the Conveniency of a running Water, but a Spring-Well, you must take your largest Tub, and put your Cloth in with cold Water, and let a Woman tramp the Cloth with her Feet, and repeat Water and tramping, till such Time as your Water come as clear from your Cloth as it went first in; then rinse your Cloth and wring it, and then lay it out upon the Green, and water it frequently for 24 Hours; then let it dry, and take hold of every Piece by the Selvedge, and draw it even to the Breadth, till you come to the further End; with the Corners of which further End, you must tie your Cloth very loosely in the Middle of your Folds, then lay it in your Bucking-Tub with the two Selvedges upwards, and place so much Cloth in your Tub, as will fill it Half full or thereby, taking Care never to pack it or press it, that your Lee may penetrate all Parts thereof; and be sure 


to put it in the Bucking-Tub; then pour on as much warm Lee, not boiling, as will search through all the Parts of the Cloth; then you may lay on more Ranges or Folds of your Cloth, in the same Manner as you did the first, till your Tub be near full, and pour on more Lee, and let it soak into the Cloth; if your Lee be very strong, you must take Care to buck but 6 or 7 Hours; but, if not over strong, you may buck 12 Hours for the first Time; your Lee, after the first three Hours bucking, must be kept warm on a gentle Fire, and, as it turns cold in the Buck, you must return it to the Boiler, and draw the Lee from the Tub, by the Means of a Cock and Pail.

AT your first two Buckings, your Lee must be strong, and after that all your Lee must be weaker; and, after first Bucking, and three Days upon the Grass bleaching, if you find your Cloth begin to whiten, your second Bucking must not be so strong as the first; for if you use too much strong Lee, you are in Danger of burning and rotting your Cloth; and the coarser your Cloth is, it must have the stronger Lee. After your Time of Bucking, lay out your Cloth upon the Grass for forty eight Hours, watering it as oft as it dries; then turn your Cloth, and let it lie as long, watering as before; then let your Cloth be rinsed with cold Water; then dry it, and buck it a second Time, and repeat your Lee as formerly, but not so strong, or so long Time in the Bucking-Tub; then lay it out, as formerly, to bleach on the Green for twenty four Hours, watering as before; then turn it, and let it lie other twenty four Hours, still watering it. **Nota,** That the Lee you use in your first two Buckings, must be of Fern, or Whin-Ashes, as in Bleaching of the Yarn; then 

rinse your Cloth in cold Water again, and let it dry upon the Grass; and your third Lee must be drawn from Ash Ashes, which will bleach it sooner and whiter than the Wood or Fern Ashes, and such as aforesaid; and if you cannot have the Ash Ashes, you may take Lime-Water, prepared after this Manner. Make to each Pound of well burnt unslacked Lime-Stone, a Pint of cold Water in a Tub, with a Cock and Pail near the Bottom of it. Let your Water stand on the Lime Stone twelve Hours, then draw off all the clear; let your Cloth be dry, and buck it in that Water for six Hours, in the Night Time; then lay out your Cloth, and water it, as aforesaid, for three Days turning it every twelve Hours. Shell Lime Water is yet better, preparing it after the foresaid Manner, only adding a third Part more Water to every Pound of well burnt unslacked Shells; and the Shells are, Oysters, Cockles, and Mussels, &c. Yet there are a great many that are Enemies to bucking of Cloth with Lime, and that because 

the Lime, penetrates and lurks in the Cloth, which burns it, and makes it of a yellow Colour; and when the Cloth is torn with Peoples Hands, you'll see the Lime fly out of it like Powder; and Ashes and Kelp, mixed among the Lee in bucking of Cloth, will lurk in it, and do as much Damage as the Lime; but Lime-Water is of a different Quality, for it can be taken inwardly by Men and Women, and it will whiten Cloth sooner than the best Lee you can make, and is less hurtful to it, When it is used as cautiously as you do the Lee: And your Shell Lime Water is far preferable to the other; for I have known a Piece of Linen, valued at forty Shillings Scots the Ell, bleached in ten Days Time, with only one Bucking of Fern-Lee, and several Buckings of Shell Lime Water, and some of it thrown on twice a Day, mixed with other Water, in the Intervals of the watering of the Cloth; so, cautiously used, it will neither burn nor spoil the Colour of the Cloth; and you may repeat bucking and watering with it as you do with other Lee. 


### Using Milk and Whey

YOUR next Method of bleaching, is your Milk and Whey mixed together, (it is a Novelty we have from France and Holland) it brings the Cloth to a better Colour, and is very good for fine Cloth. To use it, you must have a Hogshead or Fat large enough to hold the Quantity of Cloth you put in it, which you must have Half full, or near, of sour Milk and Whey.

THEY must stand and sour for some few Days, and if it be too sour ere you use it, put some Water into it, as you judge requisite; and when your Cloth is prepared and dry, you may put your Cloth therein, and let it lie there for two or three Days, according as You think fit; and put a Plank on the Top of your Cloth; and a Weight of Whin-Stone, or Flint, to hold the Plank down; because it will fret and ferment, and throw the Cloth out of the Hogshead. If this be not done, you must take Care of what Woods you put on it; for, if it be green Oak or hearted Wood, it will spoil the Colour of your Cloth; and some Kind of Stones will do the like. 


AFTER your Cloth is so steeped in the Milk, as aforesaid, then lay your Cloth upon the Green, and water it for two or three Days, that the Milk may not dry in it. When the Milk is well out of the Cloth, you must rinse it in Water, and wash it with Soap and warm Water, then buck your Cloth again to remove the Soap with Lee of Ash, or Lime-Water, and lay it out upon the Grass, where it must remain for two or three Days, still watering in the Day-Time. You must buck and bleach till you see your Cloth come to the true white Colour; for 


IT is not possible to give certain Rules 
in this Art of Bleaching; and therefore he must vary and bleach as he sees Cause, for some Cloth is easier bleached than others, particularly your fine Cloths, and your Lees may alter in their Operations: So that the Time of Bucking and Bleaching must be at the Discretion of the Bleacher, for he must take Care how to manage his Lee; or he may burn his Cloth; and his Lee must not be over hot, so he must be constantly pouring it, during the Time of Bucking, from the Top to the Bottom, and from the Bottom to the Top. Again; after it has had the last Milk, he must put his Cloth in a Tub, and tramp it with his Feet for Half an Hour and thereafter wash it clean with Water several Times till the Water come off of it as clear as when first put in the Tub.
