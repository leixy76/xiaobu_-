<p class="calibre1">Despite $30&ndash;40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&amp;L impact. This divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be determined by approach.   </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&amp;L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns emerged that define the GenAI Divide: </p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14">•</span>   <b class="calibre15">Limited disruption</b>: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change </p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14">•</span>   <b class="calibre15">Enterprise paradox</b>: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up </p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14">•</span>   <b class="calibre15">Investment bias</b>: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office </p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14">•</span>   <b class="calibre15">Implementation advantage</b>: External partnerships see twice the success rate of </p>
<p class="calibre16">internal builds </p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000022.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4" class="calibre1">While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre15">Takeaway:</b> Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely used, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing workflows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns. Despite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of organizations have moved beyond experimentation to achieve meaningful business transformation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has been embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries show the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as new market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To better quantify the state of disruption, we developed a composite AI Market Disruption Index. Each industry was scored from 0 to 5 based on five observable indicators. These scores represent normalized averages across five dimensions, triangulated from public indicators and interview-derived assessments. Alternative weighting schemes were tested to confirm consistency of industry rankings: </p>

Chatbots succeed because they're easy to try and flexible, but fail in critical workflows due to lack of memory and customization. This fundamental gap explains why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our research reveals a steep drop-off between investigations of GenAI adoption tools and pilots and actual implementations, with significant variation between generic and custom solutions. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000025.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-7" class="calibre1">The 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the GenAI Divide. Organizations stuck on the wrong side continue investing in static tools that can't adapt to their workflows, while those crossing the divide focus on learning-capable systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generic LLM chatbots appear to show high pilot-to-implementation rates (~83%). However, this masks a deeper split in perceived value and reveals why most organizations remain trapped on the wrong side of the divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-grade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, and immediate utility. Yet the same users were overwhelmingly skeptical of custom or vendor-pitched AI tools, describing them as brittle, overengineered, or misaligned with actual workflows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As one CIO put it, "We've seen dozens of demos this year. Maybe one or two are genuinely useful. The rest are wrappers or science projects." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While enthusiasm and budgets are often sufficient to launch pilots, converting these into workflow-integrated systems with persistent value remains rare, a pattern that defines the experience of organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enterprises, defined here as firms with over $100 million in annual revenue, lead in pilot count and allocate more staff to AI-related initiatives. Yet this intensity has not translated into success. These organizations report the lowest rates of pilot-to-scale conversion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By contrast, mid-market companies moved faster and more decisively. Top performers reported average timelines of 90 days from pilot to full implementation. Enterprises, by comparison, took nine months or longer. </p>

<p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre15">Five Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise</b></p>
<p class="calibre13">1.    <i class="calibre22">AI Will Replace Most Jobs in the Next Few Years</i> → Research found limited </p>
<p class="calibre16">layoffs from GenAI, and only in industries that are already affected significantly by AI. There is no consensus among executives as to hiring levels over the next 3-5 years. </p>
<p class="calibre13">2.   <i class="calibre22">Generative AI is Transforming Business →</i> Adoption is high, but </p>
<p class="calibre4">transformation is rare. Only 5% of enterprises have AI tools integrated in workflows at scale and 7 of 9 sectors show no real structural change. </p>
<p class="calibre4">3.   <i class="calibre22">Enterprises are slow in adopting new tech</i> → Enterprises are extremely eager </p>
<p class="calibre16">to adopt AI and 90% have seriously explored buying an AI solution. </p>

This "shadow AI" often delivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind the disappointing enterprise deployment numbers lies a surprising reality: AI is already transforming work, just not through official channels. Our research uncovered a thriving "shadow AI economy" where employees use personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude subscriptions, and other consumer tools to automate significant portions of their jobs, often without IT knowledge or approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scale is remarkable. While only 40% of companies say they purchased an official LLM subscription, workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of personal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some form for their work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre15">Exhibit: the shadow AI economy, employee usage far outpaces official adoption</b></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre14">Companies who have purchased LLM subscription, 40%</span></p>
<p class="calibre19"><span class="calibre14">Employees who use LLMs regularly, 90%</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">In many cases, shadow AI users reported using LLMs multiples times a day every day of their weekly workload through personal tools, while their companies' official AI initiatives remained stalled in pilot phase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This shadow economy demonstrates that individuals can successfully cross the GenAI Divide when given access to flexible, responsive tools. The organizations that recognize this pattern and build on it represent the future of enterprise AI adoption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forward-thinking organizations are beginning to bridge this gap by learning from shadow usage and analyzing which personal tools deliver value before procuring enterprise alternatives. </p>

This bias reflects easier metric attribution, not actual value, and keeps organizations focused on the wrong priorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In terms of functional focus, investment in GenAI tools is heavily concentrated. As GenAI spend is not yet formally quantified across organizations, we asked executives to allocate a hypothetical $100 to different functions. Sales and marketing functions captured approximately 70 percent of AI budget allocation across organizations in our survey. </p>

Subcategories reflect synthesized notes and anecdotal patterns, rather than precise accounting. Company type drives significant variation. For example, manufacturers and healthcare providers typically directed minimal investment to Sales &amp; Marketing and over-indexed on Operations. Tech and media firms often prioritized Marketing, Content, and Developer Productivity. Professional services leaned toward Document Automation and Legal/Compliance tools. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000028.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-10" class="calibre1">Sales and marketing dominate not only because of visibility, but because outcomes can be measured easily. Metrics such as demo volume or email response time align directly with board-level KPIs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Legal, procurement, and finance functions, in contrast, offer more subtle efficiencies. These include fewer compliance violations, streamlined workflows, or accelerated month-end processes, important but hard to surface in executive conversations or investor updates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A VP of Procurement at a Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical company expressed this challenge clearly: </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22">"If I buy a tool to help my team work faster, how do I quantify that impact? How do I justify it to my CEO when it won't directly move revenue or decrease measurable costs? I could argue it helps our scientists get their tools faster, but that's several degrees removed from bottom-line impact."</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This investment bias perpetuates the GenAI Divide by directing resources toward visible but often less transformative use cases, while the highest-ROI opportunities in back-office functions remain underfunded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond measurement challenges, trust and social proof remain decisive in purchase decisions. A Head of Procurement at a major CPG firm captured the dilemma many buyers face: </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22">"I receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best GenAI solution. Some have impressive demos, but establishing trust is the real challenge. With so many options flooding our inbox, we rely heavily on peer recommendations and referrals from our network."</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This highlights a broader pattern: product quality alone is rarely sufficient. Referrals, prior relationships, and VC introductions remain stronger predictors of enterprise adoption than functionality or feature set. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The primary factor keeping organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide is the learning gap, tools that don't learn, integrate poorly, or match workflows. Users prefer ChatGPT for simple tasks, but abandon it for mission-critical work due to its lack of memory. What's missing is systems that adapt, remember, and evolve, capabilities that define the difference between the two sides of the divide. </p>

Even avid ChatGPT users distrust internal GenAI tools that don't match their expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To understand why so few GenAI pilots progress beyond the experimental phase, we surveyed both executive sponsors and frontline users across 52 organizations. Participants were asked to rate common barriers to scale on a 1&ndash;10 frequency scale, where 10 represented the most frequently encountered obstacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The results revealed a predictable leader: resistance to adopting new tools. However, the second-highest barrier proved more significant than anticipated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The prominence of model quality concerns initially appeared counterintuitive. Consumer adoption of ChatGPT and similar tools has surged, with over 40% of knowledge workers using AI tools personally. Yet the same users who integrate these tools into personal workflows describe them as unreliable when encountered within enterprise systems. This paradox illustrates the GenAI Divide at the user level.  </p>
<p class="calibre1">This preference reveals a fundamental tension. The same professionals using ChatGPT daily for personal tasks demand learning and memory capabilities for enterprise work. A significant number of workers already use AI tools privately, reporting productivity gains, while their companies' formal AI initiatives stall. This shadow usage creates a feedback loop: employees know what good AI feels like, making them less tolerant of static enterprise tools. </p>

But this same preference exposes why organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our follow-up interviews revealed a striking contradiction. The professionals expressing skepticism about enterprise AI tools were often heavy users of consumer LLM interfaces. When asked to compare their experiences, three consistent themes emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre15">User Preference Drivers: Generic LLM Interface vs. Integrated Tool</b></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre14">"Trust it more"</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">A corporate lawyer at a mid-sized firm exemplified this dynamic. Her organization invested $50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT for drafting work: </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22">"Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options. With ChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need. The fundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, even though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology."</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This pattern suggests that a $20-per-month general-purpose tool often outperforms bespoke enterprise systems costing orders of magnitude more, at least in terms of immediate usability and user satisfaction. This paradox exemplifies why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Given users' preference for consumer LLM interfaces, we investigated what prevents broader adoption for mission-critical work. The barriers here proved distinct from general usability concerns and directly illuminated the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The same lawyer who favored ChatGPT for initial drafts drew a clear line at sensitive contracts: </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22">"It's excellent for brainstorming and first drafts, but it doesn't retain knowledge of client preferences or learn from previous edits. It repeats the same mistakes and requires extensive context input for each session. For high-stakes work, I need a system that accumulates knowledge and improves over time."</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This feedback points to the fundamental learning gap that keeps organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. Users appreciate the flexibility and responsiveness of consumer LLM interfaces but require the persistence and contextual awareness that current tools cannot provide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we asked enterprise users to rate different options for high-stakes work, the preference hierarchy became clear: </p>

<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">The results reveal that AI has already won the war for simple work, 70% prefer AI for drafting emails, 65% for basic analysis. But for anything complex or long-term, humans dominate by 9-to-1 margins. The dividing line isn't intelligence, it's memory, adaptability, and learning capability, the exact characteristics that separate the two sides of the GenAI Divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000003.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre1">Agentic AI, the class of systems that embeds persistent memory and iterative learning by design, directly addresses the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. Unlike current systems that require full context each time, agentic systems maintain persistent memory, learn from interactions, and can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows. Early enterprise experiments with customer service agents that handle complete inquiries end-to-end, financial processing agents that monitor and approve routine transactions, and sales pipeline agents that track engagement across channels demonstrate how autonomy and memory address the core gaps enterprises identify. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Organizations on the right side of the GenAI Divide share a common approach: they build adaptive, embedded systems that learn from feedback. The best startups crossing the divide focus on narrow but high-value use cases, integrate deeply into workflows, and scale through continuous learning rather than broad feature sets. Domain fluency and workflow integration matter more than flashy UX. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across our interviews, we observed a growing divergence among GenAI startups. Some are struggling with outdated SaaS playbooks and remain trapped on the wrong side of the divide, while others are capturing enterprise attention through aggressive customization and alignment with real business pain points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appetite for GenAI tools remains high. Several startups reported signing pilots within days and reaching seven-figure revenue run rates shortly thereafter. The standout performers are not those building general-purpose tools, but those embedding themselves inside workflows, adapting to context, and scaling from narrow but high-value footholds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our data reveals a clear pattern: the organizations and vendors succeeding are those aggressively solving for learning, memory, and workflow adaptation, while those failing are either building generic tools or trying to develop capabilities internally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winning startups build systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), retain context (63% demand this), and customize deeply to specific workflows. They start at workflow edges with significant customization, then scale into core processes. </p>

Enterprises are locking in learning-capable tools. Agentic AI and memory frameworks (like NANDA and MCP) will define which vendors help organizations cross the divide versus remain trapped on the wrong side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enterprises are increasingly demanding systems that adapt over time. Microsoft 365 Copilot and Dynamics 365 are incorporating persistent memory and feedback loops. OpenAI's ChatGPT memory beta signals similar expectations in general-purpose tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startups that act quickly to close this gap, by building adaptive agents that learn from feedback, usage, and outcomes, can establish durable product moats through both data and integration depth. The window to do this is narrow. In many verticals, pilots are already underway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The infrastructure to support this transition is emerging through frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, which enable agent interoperability and coordination. These protocols create market competition and cost efficiencies by allowing specialized agents to work together rather than requiring monolithic systems. And these frameworks form the foundation of the emerging Agentic Web, a mesh of interoperable agents and protocols that replaces monolithic applications with dynamic coordination layers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next few quarters, several enterprises will lock in vendor relationships that will be nearly impossible to unwind. This 18-month horizon reflects consensus from seventeen procurement and IT sourcing leaders we interviewed, supported by analysis of public procurement disclosures showing enterprise RFP-to-implementation cycles ranging from two to eighteen months. Organizations investing in AI systems that learn from their data, workflows, and feedback are creating switching costs that compound monthly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22">"We're currently evaluating five different GenAI solutions, but whichever system best learns and adapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business.

<p class="calibre1">Organizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide approach AI procurement differently, they act like BPO clients, not SaaS customers. They demand deep customization, drive adoption from the front lines, and hold vendors accountable to business metrics. The most successful buyers understand that crossing the divide requires partnership, not just purchase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across our interviews, one insight was clear: the most effective AI-buying organizations no longer wait for perfect use cases or central approval. Instead, they drive adoption through distributed experimentation, vendor partnerships, and clear accountability. These buyers are not just more eager, they are more strategically adaptive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000008.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-19" class="calibre1">In our sample, external partnerships with learning-capable, customized tools reached deployment ~67% of the time, compared to ~33% for internally built tools. While these figures reflect self-reported outcomes and may not account for all confounding variables, the magnitude of difference was consistent across interviewees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This gap explains why ChatGPT dominates for ad-hoc tasks but fails at critical workflows, and why generic enterprise tools lose to both consumer LLMs and deeply customized alternatives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The dominant barrier to crossing the GenAI Divide is not integration or budget, it is organizational design. Our data shows that companies succeed when they decentralize implementation authority but retain accountability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We observed three primary team structures for GenAI implementation, with materially different outcomes that reflect which side of the divide organizations land on. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre22"><b class="calibre15">Important Limitation:</b> These success rate differences may reflect organizational capabilities rather than implementation approach alone. Organizations choosing external partnerships may have different risk tolerance, procurement sophistication, or internal technical capacity than those building internally. The correlation between external partnerships and success does not necessarily prove causation. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Strategic partnerships achieved a significantly higher share of successful deployments than internal development efforts. While we observed far more BUILD initiatives than BUY initiatives in our sample, with many more organizations exploring internal development, the success rates favored external partnerships. Though we lack precise data on total initiative volumes, the pattern suggests that internal development efforts have substantially lower success rates despite being more commonly attempted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="images/000009.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></p>
<p id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre1">While organizations often combined approaches, pilots built via strategic partnerships were 2x as likely to reach full deployment as those built internally. More strikingly, employee usage rates were nearly double for externally built tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These partnerships often provided faster time-to-value, lower total cost, and better alignment with operational workflows. Companies avoided the overhead of building from scratch, while still achieving tailored solutions. Organizations that understand this pattern position themselves to cross the GenAI Divide more effectively. </p>

These organizations: </p>
<p class="calibre1">•   Demanded deep customization aligned to internal processes and data •   Benchmarked tools on operational outcomes, not model benchmarks •   Partnered through early-stage failures, treating deployment as co-evolution •   Sourced AI initiatives from frontline managers, not central labs </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this last pattern, individual contributors and team managers often played a critical role. Many of the strongest enterprise deployments began with power users, employees who had already experimented with tools like ChatGPT or Claude for personal productivity. These "prosumers" intuitively understood GenAI's capabilities and limits, and became early champions of internally sanctioned solutions. Rather than relying on a centralized AI function to identify use cases, successful organizations allowed budget holders and domain managers to surface problems, vet tools, and lead rollouts. This bottom-up sourcing, paired with executive accountability, accelerated adoption while preserving operational fit. </p>

Real gains come from replacing BPOs and external agencies, not cutting internal staff. Front-office tools get attention, but back-office tools deliver savings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite 50% of AI budgets flowing to sales and marketing (from the theoretical estimate with executives), some of the most dramatic cost savings we documented came from back-office automation. While front-office gains are visible and board-friendly, the back-office deployments often delivered faster payback periods and clearer cost reductions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Notably, these gains came without material workforce reduction. Tools accelerated work, but did not change team structures or budgets. Instead, ROI emerged from reduced external spend, eliminating BPO contracts, cutting agency fees, and replacing expensive consultants with AI-powered internal capabilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pattern suggests that while sales and marketing capture the majority of attention and investment, back-office automation may offer more dramatic and sustainable returns for organizations willing to look beyond the obvious use cases and truly cross the GenAI Divide. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre15">6.4.1</b>   <b class="calibre15">Displacement Patterns and Organizational Strategy </b>Our analysis reveals that GenAI-driven workforce reductions concentrate in functions historically treated as non-core business activities: customer support operations, administrative processing, and standardized development tasks. These roles exhibited vulnerability prior to AI implementation due to their outsourced status and process standardization. Executives were hesitant to reveal the scope of layoffs due to AI but it was between 5-20% of customer support operations and administrative processing work in these companies.  </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industry-specific hiring expectations reveal a clear correlation with GenAI impact patterns. In sectors showing minimal structural disruption from AI, Healthcare, Energy, Advanced Industries, most executives report no current or anticipated hiring reductions over the next five years. A few executives mentioned that they could anticipate decreased hiring but admitted that they currently do not have the systems in place to accurately predict when or where it could happen. Healthcare executives, for example, express no expectation of reducing physician or clinical staff hiring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversely, in Technology and Media sectors where GenAI has demonstrated measurable impact, &gt;80% of executives anticipate reduced hiring volumes within 24 months.  </p>

Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and static workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of negotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web decentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. Systems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling organizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and interactions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops through 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of adoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and remember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the emergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who can deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems. The organizations and vendors that recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-pilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop investing in static tools that require constant prompting, start partnering with vendors who offer custom systems, and focus on workflow integration over flashy demos. The GenAI Divide is not permanent, but crossing it requires fundamentally different choices about technology, partnerships, and organizational design. </p>
